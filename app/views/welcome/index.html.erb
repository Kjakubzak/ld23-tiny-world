<h2>What is Fish Tank Commander?</h2>
<p>FTC is a game that was created in only <em>48 hours</em> as part of
a competition called <a href="http://ludumdare.com">Ludum Dare</a>. In this
game, you fight for control of your fish tank by commanding your army of
mighty fish (and amphibians!)</p>

<p>FTC is a turn-based multiplayer game. You move your units, then end your turn and your opponent will have a chance to do the same.</p>

<p>Whenever it's your turn in a game, you'll get a notification via a little mail icon in the toolbar (this updates
	automatically without needing to refresh the page!)</p>


<h2>How do I play?</h2>
<ol>
	<li><%= link_to "Create an account!", new_user_registration_path %></li>
	<li><%= link_to "Challenge someone", new_game_path %> to a game!</li>
	<li>Create some units, like a Goldfish or a Turtle or the mighty
		Japanese Fighting Fish: The Betta!</li>
	<li>New units can't move or attack on the turn they are created, but on your
		next turn you can select and move your units around. Move onto an enemy
		to execute a devastating attack!</li>
	<li>Mouse-over the map and units to find out their traits.</li>
</ol>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>Any up-to-date web browser should be all you need, though Fish Tank Commander was primarily tested using Google Chrome.</p>

<h2>Coming Soon!</h2>

<p>48-hours isn't very long!  Here's what's planned for after the Ludum Dare voting is complete:</p>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Unit placement/movement/combat code will be improved to be much more responsive</li>
	<li>Fog of War &amp; Line of Sight</li>
	<li>More unit types including ranged units!</li>
	<li>More special abilities. See through line of sight blockers? Armor penetration? Can 'jump' over units and obstacles?</li>
	<li>There will be a system for dealing wiht stalemate situations.</li>
	<li>After being idle for a day or more (and after a notification prompting action), players will automatically surrender.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Matchmaking:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Automatic pairing based on Elo and only vs active users</li>
	<li>Ability to play a "no stats" game that won't change your Elo. Might still give XP (encourages testing of new maps!)</li>
	<li>Maps will be randomly chosen, weight by popularity (maps you downvoted should not be considered)</li>
	<li>Matches will consist of two games, where players swap red/blue teams between games</li>
	<li>Match winner will be determined based on how many turns it took to win each game</li>
	<li>Ability to decline a game without Elo loss on first turn (Direct challenges only, not matchmaking)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Website Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Emailing of notifications after a certain time (configured/disabled in Account Settings)</li>
	<li>Ranks/Leveling from XP</li>
	<li>Live chatting</li>
	<li>The ability to "email" another player by sending them a notification</li>
	<li>Individual user stat pages</li>
	<li>The ability to quickly see new maps and vote on them.</li>
	<li>Gain XP for voting on maps!</li>
	<li>Map/Game list will be paginated</li>
	<li>Facebook integration</li>
	<li>Buyout Zynga</li>
	<li>Swimming pool full of jello</li>
	<li><b>And of course: Better art!</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Found a bug? Have an idea for a new feature?</h2>

<p>I can't make changes to the actual game until after the Ludum Dare voting is complete, but I'd still love to hear your suggestions.  <a href="https://github.com/quill18/ld23-tiny-world/issues">Make suggestions and report issues here.</a> </p>
